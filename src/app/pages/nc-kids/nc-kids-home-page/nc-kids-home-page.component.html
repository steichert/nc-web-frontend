        <h2>Our Values</h2>
        <hr><br>
        <h4>PASSION FOR JESUS, WORSHIP & PRAYER</h4><br>
        <p>
            We believe that every child is called to a have a total commitment to the Lordship of Jesus Christ, and to live a life being led by the Holy Spirit. We believe that true worship is a lifestyle of obedience to God rather than only a special activity. This lifestyle leads to expressions of worshipping the Lord like thanksgiving, praise, adoration, and intimate worship using songs, instruments, dance and drama.  We believe that prayer is an important part in growing your passion and relationship with Father God.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h4>BUILDING STRONG RELATIONSHIPS AND FAMILIES</h4><br>
        <p>
            We believe that genuine relationships should permeate every part of church life.  We are committed to community and to team ministry.  We believe that transformation happens best through friendship, discipleship, outreach, serving others, internship and accountability. We believe that the church is called to bring healing to the wounded family.  This includes encouraging and ministering to parents and children.  We believe that the church is called to heal the broken-hearted and set the captives free in the power of the Holy Spirit.  This includes healing of spirit, soul and body through the Word of God, prayer and supportive relationships.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h4>EVERY BELIEVER SERVING IN MINISTRY WITH A GREAT COMMISSION MINDSET</h4><br>
        <p>
            We believe that lost people are important to God and therefore ought to be important to the church. We are called to make disciples and not just converts. We believe that every follower of Jesus is called to the work of the ministry. This includes raising up leaders who will in turn raise up others to do the same. We believe we are to serve others with meekness and compassion, not being concerned only with our own interests, but expressing Christ's tender-hearted compassion and attitude of servanthood in all that we do.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h4>POWER OF GOD'S WORD</h4><br>
        <p>
            We believe in the power and absolute truth of God's Word.  We believe that anointed teaching of, and personal study and meditation in, God's Word renews the mind and transforms lives.  This includes equipping and training for the work of ministry.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h4>KINGDOM THINKING, HOLINESS & CHARACTER</h4><br>
        <p>
            We believe that we are called to unite and flow with the whole Body of Christ to reach our communities.  We believe in honouring one another, dwelling in unity and mutual sharing of resources, gifts and abilities.  We believe that we are called to live a life of character, which includes honesty, integrity, humility, meekness, self-discipline, teachability, perseverance, and a servant heart.
        </p>
        <br><br>

        <h4>EXCELLENCE</h4><br>
        <p>
            We believe that Biblical excellence (doing the very best with what God has given) honours God and inspires people. This involves working with a strategic focus and then evaluating and reviewing our actions.

            <li>
                Teachings - The use of themes; which are divided into weekly interactive lessons; that disciple, train, and encourage spiritual growth. Each lesson is taught by an Administration or Senior Leader and aims to be understandable and fun! All lessons are flexible, yet closely monitored.
