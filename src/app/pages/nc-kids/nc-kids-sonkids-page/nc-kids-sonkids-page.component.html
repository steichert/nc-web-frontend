                NC SonKidz believes that no one is too young to have a living relationship with Jesus Christ and aims to nurture and disciple children in the ways of God. We believe in having fun in a safe and loving environment. NC SonKidz hope to reach out to our community in a way that shows the practical love of Jesus to the children in our church. NC SonKidz achieves this through a simple parent led, together with responsible helpers, program that consists of: singing songs, bible story based lessons, fun dramas and puppet shows, and lesson-focused activities! NC SonKidz is the next step after Babies Bible Class, and is for children 3 - 4 years old. It is a simple and effective programme, structured around a chosen curriculum that will build key foundations and biblical principles into your child's life, through Bible stories, songs, etc.

            <h4><u>REGISTRATION</u></h4><br>
            <p>
                NC Kidz begins with the registration process (around 08h45). Parents, upon entering the church, register their children and babies, for any of the NC Kidz ministries. First we ask that all parents register their children via our database form or online via our database link. This is for security, administration, and control purposes. Each child or baby then goes and receives a paper name bracelet (that cannot be removed by the child) in the colour of the ministry they are attending and/or NC Kidz Passport, depending on the ministry they are attending. Parents and children then go into the auditorium. We feel that it is important to worship the Lord as a family and for the babies and children to watch and learn from their parents to see how to praise the Lord. At various stages babies and children are released according to their various ages and ministries. Before entering their respective venues, Children are checked to ensure they all have a bracelet. At the end of the service time parents can fetch their children upon which the bracelets are cut off.
