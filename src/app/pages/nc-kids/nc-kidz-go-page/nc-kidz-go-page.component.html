        <h4><u>REGISTRATION</u></h4><br>
        <p>
            GO is a Friday program-based ministry aimed at children ages 12-13, which takes place in the Pavilion.
        </p>
        <p>
            Children are dropped off by their parents and can be fetched after our 2 hour program. Parents are welcome to stay and participate or just spectate during the program. GO runs a theme each term that’s aims to encourage mentorship, discussion and focus on Jesus. 
        </p>
        <p>
            All NC Kidz ministries begin with registration. We request that all parents with children check-in at the registration desk in the foyer. New parents are requested to fill in an information form and are given a booklet explaining all NC Kidz ministries. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Children are given a Name Label with their child’s name and a parent’s cell number for security purposes. Name Label is put on the child and shouldn’t be taken off by the child. Children are then escorted in the church grounds. When the program starts all the children will be ushered in the venue to begin.

        <h4><u>CORPORATE TIME (CT) 1</u></h4><br>
        <p>
            The program begins with Corporate Time (CT). The function of CT is for the kids to interact as a group in learning and understanding the lesson for the day, to worship together as a group, and finally to have fun in group based activities and games.
        </p>
        <p>
            CT is divided into two parts during the evening. The first part is where the kids are introduced to the theme of the day and enjoy corporate worship! This CT consists of welcoming the kids, having praise and worship, presenting the teaching and drama, and occasionally a large group game is played depending on time.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Welcome</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp; This kicks off the program, getting the kids attention and settling them down.</li>
          <li><b>Prayer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;We give prayer unto the Father to welcome, honour, and spend time with Him.</li>
          <li><b>Announcements</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;We welcome new kids, discuss upcoming events, and chat about matters that need attention.</li>
          <li><b>Theme Intro</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The theme for the day is introduced and the term/year theme is recapped.</li>
          <li><b>Praise and Worship</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Praise and Worship gets the kids singing and worshipping in order to honour God and ushering in His presence!</li>
          <li><b>Teaching</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;A teaching is given based on the theme to get the kids thinking and equipping them with knowledge. Teachings consist of illustrations, dramas, and discussion. </li>
        </ul>

        <h4><u>SESSION TIME</u></h4><br>
        <p>
            Session Time (ST) follows CT! The function of ST is to build relationship between the kids and the leaders, so that the theme of the day may be emphasised and that areas within the kids’ lives that need attention may be identified.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>Sessions consist of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Prayer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Open the time with prayer!</li>
          <li><b>Welcome</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Welcome all the kids, spend time finding out about the new kids (if any), and find out what were the weeks events in their lives!</li>
          <li><b>Memory Verse</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The Memory Verse of the day is practiced and previous verses are tested.</li>
          <li><b>Story/Illustration</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;A bible story and/or an illustration based on the theme helps emphasize and explain the day's message!</li>
          <li><b>Activity/Game</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;An activity and/or game helps children to memorize the theme and message of the day! The activity or game must be well prepared and also must be age appropriate!</li>
          <li><b>Prayer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;A prayer ends off the Group Time.</li>    
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <br><br>

        <h4><u>CORPORATE TIME (CT) 2</u></h4><br>
        <p>
            We meet again for CT after the ST to recap the day, play a game, have a final praise song and to go through any announcements again. The kids then leave; collecting flyers covering all announcements.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Game Time</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;We play a game that is lesson based and aims to bring unity between the leaders and the children.</li>
          <li><b>Praise</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Praise gets the kids singing and worshipping in order to honour God!</li>
          <li><b>Wrap-up</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;A recap of the day is done and kids are tested on the memory verse for the day.</li>
          <li><b>Announcements</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;A recap of all announcements is given.</li>
          <li><b>Prayer</b>&nbsp;-&nbsp;We end off giving prayer unto the Father to protect us and aid us in implanting what was learnt into our lives.</li>
        </ul>
