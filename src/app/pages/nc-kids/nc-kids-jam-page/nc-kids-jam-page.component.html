        <h4><u>REGISTRATION</u></h4><br>
        <p>
          JAM is a Friday program-based ministry aimed at children ages 7-12, which takes place in the venue Upper Room. Children are dropped off by their parents and can be fetched after our 2 hour program. Parents are welcome to stay and participate or just spectate during the program. 
        </p>
        <p>
          JAM runs a theme each term which is divided in 4-5 Lessons. During the term we also have 2-3 Event Fridays. Events are aimed at building relationship; either between children and leaders or children and parents. 
        </p>
        <p>
          All NC Kidz ministries begin with registration. We request that all parents with children check-in at the registration desk in the foyer. New parents are requested to fill in an information form and are given a booklet explaining all NC Kidz ministries. Children are given a Name Label with their child’s name and a parent’s cell number for security purposes. The Name Label is put on the child and shouldnt be taken off by the child. Children are then escorted in the church grounds.
        </p>
        <p>
          The children can play on the supervised Jungle-Gym, play soccer on the basketball court, or hang out with the leaders in Upper Room. When the program starts all the children will be ushered in the venue to begin.

        <h4><u>CORPORATE TIME (CT) 1</u></h4><br>
        <p>
          The program begins with Corporate Time (CT). The function of CT is for the kids to interact as a group in learning and understanding the lesson for the day, to worship together as a group, and finally to have fun in group based activities and games.
        </p>
        <p>
          CT is divided into two parts during the evening. The first part is where the kids are introduced to the theme of the day and enjoy corporate worship! This CT consists of welcoming the kids, having praise and worship, presenting the teaching and drama, and occasionally a large group game is played depending on time.

ST consists of prayer, bible stories and illustrations, theme discussions, activities, and the occasional game.
