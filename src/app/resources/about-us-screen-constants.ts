This family welcomes and embraces Christ-followers, and any who are interested in him, from all economic backgrounds, irrespective of ethnicity, language, gender, age, socio-economic background etc. In fact, in doing so, we seek to understand and represent the multi-faceted nature of God's rich grace and love. We are learning to be reconciled to God through Christ also means reconciliation at its deepest level with one another, and that celebrating and transcending our differences as well as our similarities helps us to more accurately experience as well as demonstrate who God is. Since all family begins with nuclear family in all of its many incarnations, we place a high value on strengthening parents and children, and ministering to brokenness and hurt in family life. Since we are only a small part of God's vast family, we seek to relate and to learn from a variety of church expressions and flows.",

Every person who is in Christ has been gifted and empowered to serve as a part of this body in relationship with others. When each part does its work, the whole body grows and becomes healthy. Because Christ is the head of the body, other roles and functions are just that - we do not emphasise position and title, but function and gifting. Team is an important concept for us, and we resist attempts within and outside of ourselves to elevate one gifting or role unduly above others. Scripture and authority support the body with the ability to move and accomplish God-given tasks, but should not overwhelm it or be starkly visible. Leadership is expressed more through fatherhood and motherhood than through corporate structuring. Because the church is a body, God places each person where He wants them to be and each becomes an integral part of the health and life of that body.",
